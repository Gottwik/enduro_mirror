	background: 'I am a professional software developer with passion for deep learning. After finishing my computer science masters, I worked at Tim Dynamics at a autonomous submarine project. The amazing complexities of developing highly sofisticated diving model was astonishing. Sadly, after the submarine got stuck nearly 2 kilometers under the see surface, our funding was stopped. I became a freelance deep learning specialist and now enjoy diversity of projects ranging from medical research to video game AI.',
